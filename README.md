Elevator-Simulation
===================

To compile the simulation program, type : $make all
To run the simulation program, type : $java simulation/Simulation n f file

I used a testfile that is placed in the directory "testfiles" with tha name : people.txt
You can add your own testfile. Use the same format.

There is no verifier since i didn't have the time to complete the project.
